# Game Capture HD Linux driver

This project provides a userspace driver to natively support the Elgato Game
Capture HD under Linux and Mac OS X. This is an unofficial driver and in no way
supported by Elgato.

Use at your own risk! This software is experimental and not intended for
production use.

Official Groupchat at Gitter: https://gitter.im/tolga9009/elgato-gchd


### Supported devices

* Elgato Game Capture HD

### Unsupported devices

* Elgato Game Capture HD60 (work in progress)
* Elgato Game Capture HD60 S
* Elgato Game Capture HD60 Pro


## Firmware

This software needs Elgato Game Capture HD firmware files to work. Due to
licensing issues, they're not part of this repository.

You need to extract them yourself from the Windows "Game Capture" software,
or the official Mac OS X drivers. Getting it from each is a different process.

See https://github.com/tolga9009/elgato-gchd/wiki/Firmware

**Note**: If you're a Mac OS X user, simply install the official drivers. You
don't need to manually extract the firmware files.

## Install

1. Install the following dependencies. Please refer to your specific Linux
distribution, as package names might differ.

* libusb >= 1.0.20
* cmake (make)
* make (make)
* qt5 (optional) - for GUI support (not usable, work in progress)

2. Compile the driver:

1. Either clone or download the Git repository and extract it.

2. Open up a terminal inside the project's root directory.

3. Create a new directory `build` in the project's root directory and
navigate into it:

```
mkdir build
cd build
```

4. Run CMake from inside the `build` directory to setup the make
environment and compile the driver:

```
cmake ..
make
```

5. The compiled executable `gchd` is located in `build/src`. If you have
Qt5 installed on your system, the GUI `qgchd` will be located at
`build/src/gui`.
**Note**: you can copy the firmware files into these directories and test
the application, without making any system-wide modifications.

3. If the application works for you, you can optionally install it system-wide,
running `make install` from within the `build` directory. This will install the
executables to `/usr/bin`.


## Usage

### Commandline

```
Usage: gchd [options]

Options:
-c <color-space>   Color Space settings [default: autodetect]
-f <format>        Format for <output> [default: fifo]
-h                 Print this screen
-i <input-source>  Input Source [default: autodetect]
-n <ip-address>    IP address for UDP streaming [default: 0.0.0.0]
-o <output>        Output Path [default: /tmp/gchd.ts]
-p <port>          Port for UDP streaming [default: 57384]
-r <resolution>    Output resolution [default: same as input source]
-v                 Print program version
-P <pid-path>      PID path [default: /var/run/gchd.pid]
```

Options for `<color-space>` are `yuv` and `rgb`. Consoles and PCs output in
either format and usually don't support switching Color Spaces. If this option
is set incorrectly, your capture will either have a green or purple tint.
If this is not set the driver will attempt to autodetect.

Options for `<format>` are `disk`, `fifo` and `socket`. Use `disk`, if you want
to directly record to your harddrive. Else, FIFO will cover almost all use cases
(default). Please note, that FIFOs won't grow in size, making them optimal for
streaming and more controlled capturing on systems with limited amount of memory
or SSDs. When set to `socket`, this driver will stream the output via UDP to
`<ip-address>`:`<port>` (default `0.0.0.0:57384`).

Options for `<input-source>` are `composite`, `component` and `hdmi`. Choose,
whichever source you're using. Some resolutions are not available on all input
sources. If you do not specify the input source, the driver will attempt
to autodetect.

You can specify `<ip-address>` using `-n` option. The driver will stream to this
IP address, instead of default `0.0.0.0`. Please note, UDP streaming is highly
experimental at this point. Unicast works well, but Multicasting has performance
issues, causing artefacts. Multicast IPs are in the range of `224.0.0.0` -
`239.255.255.255` (RFC 5771).

`<output>` sets the location either for the FIFO or the capture file,
depending on whether `-d` has been set or not.

You can change the default `<port>` using `-p` option. Default is set in private
port range (RFC 6335) to `57384` (EGCHD).

Options for `<resolution>` are `ntsc`, `pal`, `720` and `1080`. If unspecified
this defaults to using whatever resolution the input source is at. Note that
currently some users are experiencing video and audio artifacts if the
resolution doesn't match the input size.

`<pid-path>` is unused at the moment. Once implemented, it will provide a
single-instance mechanism, which will prevent this driver from opening multiple
times. You can use this option in the future, if you're running this driver as a
non-root user and don't have write access to the default `<pid-path>` location.


### General

This driver must be run as root, as it needs to access your Game Capture HD
device. Under Linux, you can alternatively follow the directions at:

https://github.com/tolga9009/elgato-gchd/wiki/Configuring-the-Driver-to-be-Run-Without-Root-Permissions

This will make it accessible to non-root users.

If no commandline options are set, the device will autodetect what source you
have, HDMI, Component, or Composite. It will also autodetect the streamed
resolution and colorspace. It will not however handle these changing on the fly.
The detection for whetjer you are using HDMI/Component/Composite may malfunction
in the following cases:

* There is no signal at all. It often will detect no signal as a signal of
various types.
* Multiple cables are connected between devices, IE: HDMI and Composite. Just
being connected through to another device, even one that is off, can mess up
the autodetection.
* Multiple signals being sent simultaneously.

By default, a FIFO will be created at `/tmp/gchd.ts`. You can open it up using
any media player, which supports reading from pipes (e.g. VLC or obs-studio).
There will be a slight delay, which is a hardware limitation and can't be worked
around.

If you're done using this driver, close the file, stop the terminal using
"Ctrl + C" and wait for the program to successfully terminate. The driver will
resetting your device. If you interrupt this step, it will leave your device in
an undefined state and you will need to manually reset your device by
reconnecting it.

Currently supported input sources:

* HDMI: 480p60 (NTSC), 576p60 (PAL), 720p60, 1080i60, 1080p60
* Component: 480i60 (NTSC), 480p60 (NTSC), 576i50 (PAL), 576p50 (PAL), 720p60,
1080i60, 1080p60
* Composite: 480i60 (NTSC), 576i50 (PAL)
