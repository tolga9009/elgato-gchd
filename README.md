Elgato Game Capture HD - Linux drivers
======================================

Reverse engineering the Elgato Game Capture HD to make it work under Linux.

We all love our Elgatos, we all love our Linux machines. I've been in contact
with Elgato several times and talked to them about this topic, but they don't
plan adding Linux support and they also can't help Linux developers, due to NDA
restrictions. As a result, they can't support any reverse engineering efforts.

Everyone who can help us is welcome, it doesn't matter if you want to program,
improve the documentation or research. Please note, that this driver is in a
very early development stage and not ready for use.

Currently, it's possible to receive a 720p60 HDMI input and save it to a file.

Please note, that we can't take any feature requests, as we are currently in the
process of figuring out, how the device actually works.


Current TODOs
=============

- port C++ code to C code
- implement sparam, slsi, statechange, scmd, boot and dlfirm functions
- figure out i2c write and i2c stat functions
- 1080p support


About the device
================

After studying the video output and USB packets, the Elgato Game Capture HD
seems to be one hell of device! This little thing directly outputs compressed

Steven Toth from Kernel Labs noted, that the device is outputting native
ISO13818 TS packets. Once the device is set up, we should be able to get the
video stream without any encoding. Thank you Steve for the hint!
